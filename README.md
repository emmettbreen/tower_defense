# Tower Defense
## 2019
A tower defense game written in Java for my final project in AP Computer Science A. The objective is to remove as many enemies as you can before they reach the tower. The number of enemies you remove is your score. To remove them, the user simply has to click on them. However, this is easier said than done as they move quickly and spawn randomly. The game features:

- a graphical user interface
- mouse click interactions
- a score displayed in the terminal

My main contributions include:

- Game.java, the main class that runs the game, spawns new enemies, and checks for mouse clicks
- Position.java, a class to represent coordinates on the GUI
- Enemy.java, a class that creates enemies and aims them at destroying the tower

My main takeaways were:

- understanding how backend principles interact with a frontend user interface
- using geometry and trigonometry to calculate the enemy trajetory towards the tower
- developing software that included real-time inputs from the user and developing immediate responses
